This is my take on a simple practice project, 
I am still learning Java Script so i wanted to practice and create a to do list, but i also wanted to put my little spin on it so i diceded to create the to do list but make it look and feel like you are working in a cmd.This took quite some time considering i am new at this. So dont judge me too hard : ) if i have messed something up also still learning how to use github and im sorry if this isn't set up porperly. Anyway i hope you will like my website and enjoy it.

Here is the link if you want to check it out for yourself.
