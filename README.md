# ðŸ’» CmDoo
CmDoo is a take on a simple ToDo practice project, but with my little spin on it. So i am still learning JavaScript and i saw that one of the practice projects was a To Do list. So i decided to make just that but styled like a terminal. It took quite some time to make this project because as i said i am still learning : ). I hope you will like and enjoy my Terminal Styled To Do List. And if you want to check the website out for yourself here is the link: https://cm-doo.vercel.app/
